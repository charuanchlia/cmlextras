# cml-extras

This python library has added functionality for [Cloudera Machine Learning (CML)](https://docs.cloudera.com/machine-learning/cloud/product/topics/ml-product-overview.html#cdsw_overview)'s cml library. The library is organized in modules and is built on the CML Workers API and other CML functionality.

## Installation

## Modules

### Ray
Ray is a unified framework for scaling AI and Python applications. We can create a cluster on CML infrastructure to scale out Ray processes. This `cmlextras.ray_cluster` module abstracts the ray cluster provisioning and operations so users can focus on their application code instead of infrastructure management. 

## Contribute 
We welcome (and encourage!) all forms of contributions, including patches and PRs, reporting issues, submitting feature requests, and any feedback.
